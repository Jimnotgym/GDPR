# GDPR
A collection of resources designed to help with GDPR compliance

GDPR - The General Data Protection Regulation

My main tip for compliance projects like this is don't be scared, but take it seriously

Start with the weblinks for some background
The documents folder contains a useful 12 step plan
For a simple organisation compliance starts with making a list of the kind of data you hold, then taking your time to note next to it why you are holding it.

I have started to come across a lot of resources related to GDPR, and thought I would put them somewhere safe where we can all use them. Pull requests are very welcome (and if you don't do pull requests contact me and I'll take submissions by email)


At the moment it is a dumping ground of stubs of articles and a few links, but I have some genuinely useful stuff to add later! Sorry it is a mess right now
New submissions will be added whenever I find them!
