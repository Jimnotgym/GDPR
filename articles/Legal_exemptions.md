#Legal exemptions from GDPR

There is a specific exemption [citation needed] for data that you are legally required to keep. Perhaps the biggest reason you may have to keep records is for income and sales tax. In the UK,for instance, you are required to keep VAT records for 6 years, including a record of all of the people you have invoiced including their names and addresses. This gives you an immediate reason for keeping your customer information, but won't exempt you from the requirements to keep it securely [citation needed]. You are also going to need to document what you have and where and why.
