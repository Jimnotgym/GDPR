# IT security and GDPR
My first impression of what GDPR compliance was going to entail is that it was just another set of boxes to tick (or leave unticked in the case of newsletter preferences!). If you already undertake something like PCI compliance, you will already have a lot of what you need in place.

I am always in favour of making life easy for myself, and to this end I have one overriding piece of advice for data security.

If you don't need to keep a piece of data, don't record it. In fact don't even ask for it! Second best is to delete it as soon as possible, but even this will require some work and some documentation. Also consider whether you can offload the overhead of storage to a third party who can warranty you that they are compliant.
