# New places to look for data

It has struck me that what will affect organisations that are already following some kind of data compliance, are the new things which will be considered regulated data after GDPR

## Website server logs
When someone visits your website they will most likely leave their IP address in your server logs. This is identifyable data and you will need a reason to keep it. If you are not using it for analytics, then maybe deleting on a schedule is a good idea. If you never read them /dev/null (this stops them being recorded at all) may be a better place, however this will limit your diagnostic capabilities.

## Employee data
Yes all of the data you hold about your employees will be covered by GDPR. Would you be happy right now to share everything you are holding about an employee with them?
